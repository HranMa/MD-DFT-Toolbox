# md-scripts

This project is designed to store some auxiliary scripts written with ChatGPT during MD simulation.
(Of course, DFT calculations including, too)

Most of the scripts can be run in the WSL with Ubuntu 22.04 installed, since it's much convenient to set up than normal Windows enviroment. 

If you're a graduate student under the guidence of Prof. Wang Dan and have used the scripts in this project, remember to Star it.
